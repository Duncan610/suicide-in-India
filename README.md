**Exploratory Data Analysis on Suicide Rates in India**

**Project Overview**

This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of suicide rates in India from the years 2001 to 2012.
The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into the factors contributing to suicide rates across different states, genders, and age groups.

**Data Source**
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajanand/suicides-in-india
It includes detailed records of suicide incidents across various states and demographics over the specified period.

**Key Objectives**
Understand the overall trends in suicide rates in India from 2001 to 2012.
Analyze suicide rates by gender, age group, and state, type and type code.
Identify any significant patterns or anomalies in the data.
Visualize the findings using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.

**Analysis Steps**

**Descriptive Statistics:**

Computed summary statistics to understand the distribution of data.
Analyzed measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

**Trend Analysis:**

Investigated year-over-year changes in suicide rates.
Identified any increasing or decreasing trends.

**Demographic Analysis:**

Compared suicide rates across different genders and age groups.
Analyzed the impact of socio-economic factors on suicide rates.

**Geographical Analysis:**

Visualized suicide rates across different states.
Highlighted states with the highest and lowest suicide rates.

**Key Findings**
Trend Analysis: Identified a significant increase/decrease in suicide rates over the analyzed period.
**Gender Comparison:** Found that Males had higher suicide rates at approximately 4.6 million cases compared to Females at 2.6 million cases

**Age Group Analysis**: Highlighted that the 15-29 age group had the highest number of suicides.

**State-wise Analysis:** Discovered that Maharashatra state had the highest suicide rate.

**Visualizations**
Bar plots, line charts were used to visualize trends and comparisons.

**Conclusion**
The EDA provided valuable insights into the suicide rates in India, highlighting critical areas for further investigation and potential intervention.
The findings can aid policymakers, researchers, and mental health professionals in developing targeted strategies to address the issue of suicides in India.

**Future Work**
Expand the analysis to include more recent data.
Conduct predictive modeling to forecast future suicide trends.
Investigate the impact of additional socio-economic factors not covered in the current analysis.
